# Jobdata
  
## Objectives

* Analyze job projections from Statistics Canada to get an overall picture of the projected labour market. 
* Learn Python and the Anaconda package through practical application
* Leverage Github's support for jupyter notebooks through nbviewer to showcase both developmental and presentation aspects of data analysis

## Result Overview

Provides a step by step analysis of job projection data (2015-2014) from [Statistics Canada](http://www.statcan.gc.ca). Key trends in the data indicate high projected demand for medical professionals over the 9 year period. Truck drivers wre projected to face the biggest shortage in labour to the tune of around 27 thousand. On the other side of the spectrum, occupations around sports and athletes lead the occupations facing larbour surplus over the coming years. Other occupation that featured prominently in the labour surplus category include graphic designers, illustrators, food and beverage attendants and general labourers.

## Tools

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) - An open data platform powered by python. Bundled with python, jupyter and Spyder IDE. I extensively used jupyter notebooks for ease of development and visualisation along the way.
* Github for version control
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - An open source library providing powerful and easy to use data analysis tools for Python. 
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) - Added at the end of the project to add interactive graphs and visualisations. Offers easy to use tools with a wide variety of high quality graphics.

## Learning outcomes

* Better understanding of python and how to leverage libraries for easier development
* Introduction to jupyter notebooks where I had to combine code snippets and markdown for a more interactive walkthrough of the analysis
* Iterative code refactoring to DRY code and leverage inbuilt functions and libraries
* More practice on reading documentation and seeking help with targeted questions
